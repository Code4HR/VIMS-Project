The team evaluated and developed open-source visualization software and public deliberative polling guidance.\n\nCurrently funding and co-hosting the Hampton Roads Adaptation Forum with Old Dominion University and the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission. The Forum is a regular meeting among local government officials, federal facility managers, and university researchers to discuss the best available science and best management practices for adaptation.\n\nCurrently funding VASG Law Fellows to work with the VCPC on legal and policy research on local government authorities, jurisdictions and options related to climate change\n\nFunded community listening sessions throughout several Hampton Roads communities (particularly SE Virginia, Eastern Shore, and Middle Peninsula) and a planning evaluation in the City of Virginia Beach through the University of Virginia's Institute for Environmental Negotiation and the Department of Planning \n\nEntered MOUs to support students and faculty in the Virginia Coastal Policy Clinic (VCPC) and to co-fund a Faculty of Practice member with Old Dominion University to conduct climate science synthesis and outreach to the Hampton Roads region. VCPC is now part of the National Sea Grant Law Network, consisting of a dozen legal programs providing advisory services and outreach to decision-makers nation-wide through the state Sea Grant programs. The Faculty of Practice becomes a member of the National Sea Grant Climate Network, a professional network of climate outreach staff sharing best practices and lessons learned nation-wide. ",

The task force will test the ability of eachchosen resiliency strategy to improve resiliency of marsh islands at a high, medium, and low wave energy study sites. The living shoreline concept will be applied to island geography by restoring eroded sand and plant materials and protecting the perimeter of the islands with various substrates such as traditional rock sills, crushed concrete, oyster castles, and native mussels. All sills will be vented to allow for intertidal flow. High marsh elevations and associated plants will be emphasized as much as possible to increase resiliency to sea level rise over time.

As such, the group's work has focused primarily on adaptation to sea level, participating in every major sea level rise conversation in the region, assisting local governments in addressing sea level rise, working to stop unwise development in areas likely to be affected by sea level rise, developing a toolkit for local governments to use in approaching adaptation efforts, partnering to host listening sessions in Virginia Beach and the Eastern Shore to facilitate an open public dialogue on sea level rise, assisting numerous researchers and members of the press to understand the flooding situation in Hampton Roads and increase visibility of the sea level rise problem, engaging the private sector on the problem and adaptation, and developing a study of private homeowners insurance and its potential influence on adaptation. They are also taking a look at changes to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and possible incentives for sea level rise adaptation, and a review of the NFIP's Community Rating System (CRS) and the potential for landscape and habitat approaches to flood plain management to incentivize adaptation and good floodplain management through flood insurance discounts. As well, Wetlands Watch is looking at how to generate co-benefits from green infrastructure approaches to flood plain management for stormwater pollution reduction efforts. Finally, Wetlands Watch is beginning to develop land-use education workshops for citizens to advocate for smart land use in the face of sea level rise, has recently released an app to track flooding problems at the street level and changes over time called Sea Level Rise (currently available on iPhone), and is hosting an adaptation design project to develop innovative ideas for adaptation in a Hampton Roads community.",

        "description": "Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program is Virginia's coastal communities face a range of climate-related threats including rising water levels, more frequent and stronger hurricanes and storms, changes in precipitation patterns and warmer air and water temperatures. These changes will affect coastal habitats and the livelihoods and lifestyles of coastal residents. The most publicized change is the expected rise in sea level, which is predicted to be at least two feet within the next 100 years, or double the rate from the past century. The region has added vulnerability because it is also gradually subsiding as a result of geologic changes related to the last ice age. As a result, Virginia faces the highest rate of relative sea level rise on the East Coast. Recognizing the potential severity of these changes, The Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program has undertaken a number of initiatives to help coastal communities adapt to the climate change impacts that now appear inevitable. Efforts have included a multiyear initiative to promote 'living shorelines' to help mitigate wetland loss from sea level rise, public education projects, and funding for Virginia's eight planning district commissions (PDCs).",
